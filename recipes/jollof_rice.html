    </ul>
    <br />

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash the rice thoroughly and soak it in cold water for about 30 minutes.
        Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using chicken, shrimp, or tofu, season and cook them separately until
        they are fully cooked. Set aside.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <h3>Prepare the Jollof Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a blender, combine the diced tomatoes, scotch bonnet peppers, and
        bouillon powder or cube (if using). Blend until smooth.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <h3>Cook the Jollof Rice</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over
        medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>Add the chopped onions and sauté until they become translucent.</li>
      <li>
        Stir in the minced garlic and ginger (if using) and sauté for another
        minute or until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the finely chopped red and green bell peppers and continue to sauté
        until they soften.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the blended tomato mixture and stir well. Allow it to cook down
        for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until the sauce thickens
        and the oil begins to separate from the tomato mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the sauce with thyme, curry powder, paprika or cayenne pepper
        (for heat), white or black pepper, and salt to taste. Adjust the
        seasoning to your preference.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the drained rice to the pot and stir to coat it evenly with the
        sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth (or water) to cover the rice
        completely. Add mixed vegetables (if using).
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and
        simmer for 25-30 minutes or until the rice is cooked and has absorbed
        the liquid. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you cooked protein earlier, add it back to the pot during the last 5
        minutes of cooking to heat through.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
