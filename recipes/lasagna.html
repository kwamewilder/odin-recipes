    <br />

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Tomato Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        Add the minced garlic and chopped onion. Sauté until the onion becomes
        translucent and fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>Pour in the tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes.</li>
      <li>
        Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and your choice of herbs (basil,
        oregano, and thyme are common choices).
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, to
        allow the flavors to meld. Adjust seasoning as needed.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Meat Filling (Optional)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a separate skillet, brown the ground meat over medium-high heat,
        breaking it apart with a spoon as it cooks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add minced garlic and chopped onion to the meat and sauté until they are
        softened and the meat is fully cooked.
      </li>
      <li>Season the meat with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>Once cooked, drain any excess fat from the meat.</li>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Béchamel Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Stir in the flour to create a smooth paste, known as a roux.</li>
      <li>Gradually whisk in the milk, ensuring there are no lumps.</li>
      <li>
        Continue to cook and whisk until the sauce thickens and comes to a
        gentle boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the béchamel sauce with salt and a pinch of nutmeg. Remove it
        from the heat.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>
        In a deep baking dish, start by spreading a thin layer of tomato sauce
        on the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>Place a layer of lasagna pasta sheets on top of the sauce.</li>
      <li>
        Add a portion of the meat filling (if using) and spread it evenly.
      </li>
      <li>Spoon some béchamel sauce over the meat.</li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle a portion of mozzarella, Parmesan, and ricotta cheese over the
        sauce.
      </li>
      <li>Add optional sautéed vegetables at this point, if desired.</li>
      <li>
        Repeat these layers (pasta, meat, béchamel, cheese, and vegetables)
        until you've used up your ingredients. Ensure you finish with a layer of
        cheese on top.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <h3>Step 5: Bake and Serve</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cover the baking dish with foil to prevent excessive browning and bake
        in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the
        top is golden brown and the lasagna is bubbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving to allow it to
        set.
      </li>
      <li>Slice and serve your delicious homemade lasagna.</li>
    </ol>
