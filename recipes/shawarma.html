    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>Marinate the Meat</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a bowl, combine minced garlic, cumin, paprika, turmeric, coriander,
        cayenne pepper, salt, black pepper, yogurt, and olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the boneless chicken thighs or beef strips to the marinade, ensuring
        they are well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or
        overnight for best results).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <h3>Cook the Marinated Meat</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Grill the marinated meat
        until fully cooked and slightly charred, about 5-7 minutes per side.
      </li>
      <li>Remove the meat from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>Slice the cooked meat into thin strips.</li>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <h3>Assemble the Shawarma</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Warm the pita bread rounds in the oven or on the stovetop. Place a
        generous spoonful of tahini sauce on each pita bread.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer on shredded lettuce, cucumber, tomato slices, and sliced meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle more tahini sauce on top, and squeeze fresh lemon juice over the
        filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap the pita bread around the filling to form a shawarma sandwich.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
